description: Ingest a paper into the wiki — creates pages (papers + concepts + methods + people) and builds all cross-references and graph edges. Trigger whenever the user says "ingest", "add this paper", drops a `.pdf` / `.tex` / arXiv URL, or asks to fold a paper into the knowledge base.

# /ingest

Turn one paper into a fully wired set of wiki pages. Emit well-formed entities and correct cross-references; leave semantic audits (backlink symmetry, dangling nodes, field-value policing) for `/check`.

Use these local references on demand:

- `references/pdf-preprocessing.md` — arXiv-ID recovery, tex fetching, prepare-paper handoff for direct PDF drops
- `references/dedup-policy.md` — merge-vs-create decision rule for concepts and methods, and the line that separates `/ingest` shape checks from `/check` semantic audits
- `references/cross-references.md` — forward/reverse link matrix and paper-to-paper edge-type selection
- `references/init-mode.md` — manifest-driven handoff from `/init` and parallel-safety conventions
- `references/error-handling.md` — source parse, API, and slug-collision fallbacks

Open `runtime/schema/entities.yaml` for frontmatter field definitions and `runtime/templates/{kind}.md.tmpl` for body section structure. For `index.md`, `log.md`, and `graph/` shapes, see `runtime/schema/conventions.yaml` and `runtime/schema/edges.yaml`.

## Inputs

- `source`: one of — arXiv URL (e.g. `https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685`), local `.tex`, local `.pdf`, or a `canonical_ingest_path` handed off by `/init` via `.checkpoints/init-sources.json`(see `references/init-mode.md`)
- `--discover` (optional, default **off**): after the final report, invoke `/discover --anchor <this-paper's-arxiv-id>` and append the shortlist to the report as "Related papers you may want to ingest next". Never auto-ingests the suggestions. Skipped automatically in INIT MODE. Treat this as a user-owned flag: do not set it based on repo state.
- `--visualize` (optional, default **off**): after Step 7 rebuild, regenerate Canvas visualization artifacts via `tools/visualize.py generate-canvas`. Skipped automatically in INIT MODE — the parent `/init` handles visualization once at fan-in. Treat this as a user-owned flag: do not set it based on repo state. (The interactive web Graph view lives in the SPA at `app/modules/graph.js`, served by `tools/serve.py`; it reads `wiki/graph/` live and needs no per-ingest regeneration.)

## Outputs

- One fully-wired paper page plus linked entities (concepts, methods, people)
- Graph edges and citations appended via `tools/research_wiki.py`
- Terminal summary with page counts and suggested follow-up ingests

## Wiki Interaction

### Reads

- `wiki/index.md` for existing slugs and tags
- `wiki/papers/*.md` to detect an already-ingested paper
- `wiki/concepts/*.md` and `wiki/foundations/*.md` for dedup matches
- `wiki/methods/*.md` for dedup matches against existing reusable methods
- `wiki/people/*.md` for existing authors
- `wiki/topics/*.md` to place the paper under existing topics
- `wiki/graph/open_questions.md` to notice when the paper addresses a known gap

### Writes

- `wiki/papers/{slug}.md` — CREATE
- `wiki/concepts/{slug}.md` — CREATE (new) or EDIT (append `key_papers`, aliases, variants)
- `wiki/methods/{slug}.md` — CREATE (new, only when the method is named, reusable, and citable across papers) or EDIT (append `source_papers`)
- `wiki/people/{slug}.md` — CREATE (importance ≥ 4 only) or EDIT (append into `## Recent work`)
- `wiki/topics/{slug}.md` — EDIT only (no CREATE from `/ingest`)
- `wiki/graph/edges.jsonl` — APPEND via tool
- `wiki/graph/citations.jsonl` — APPEND via tool
- `wiki/graph/context_brief.md` — REBUILD (skipped in INIT MODE)
- `wiki/graph/open_questions.md` — REBUILD (skipped in INIT MODE)
- `wiki/index.md` — APPEND
- `wiki/log.md` — APPEND via tool
- `wiki/canvases/*.canvas` — CREATE/OVERWRITE (only when `--visualize` is set and not in INIT MODE)

### Graph edges created

- `paper → concept`: `introduces_concept` / `uses_concept` / `extends_concept` / `critiques_concept` with `confidence`
- `paper → foundation`: `derived_from` (foundation is terminal; no reverse link)
- `paper → paper`: `same_problem_as` / `similar_method_to` / `complementary_to` / `builds_on` / `compares_against` / `improves_on` / `challenges` / `surveys` with `confidence`
- bibliographic `paper → paper`: `cites` in `graph/citations.jsonl`

`tools/research_wiki.py add-edge` rejects missing confidence/evidence for
paper-paper and paper-concept semantic edges, and rejects legacy
paper-to-concept or paper-to-paper types on new writes.

## Workflow

**Pre-condition**: working directory contains `wiki/`, `raw/`, and `tools/`. Resolve the Python interpreter once and reuse it:

```bash
# Find the project root via git so worktree subagents can still locate .venv.
# .venv is gitignored, so a subagent whose cwd is ../.worktrees/<branch>/
# doesn't have one — without this lookup it falls back to system python3 and
# misses the .env-loaded API keys plus the installed deps (deepxiv-sdk etc.).
# git rev-parse --git-common-dir returns the main repo's .git regardless of
# which worktree the shell is in; its parent is the project root.
GIT_COMMON_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null || true)
PROJECT_ROOT=""
if [ -n "$GIT_COMMON_DIR" ]; then
  PROJECT_ROOT=$(cd "$(dirname "$GIT_COMMON_DIR")" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
fi

if   [ -x "$PROJECT_ROOT/.venv/bin/python" ];         then PYTHON_BIN="$PROJECT_ROOT/.venv/bin/python"
elif [ -x "$PROJECT_ROOT/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" ]; then PYTHON_BIN="$PROJECT_ROOT/.venv/Scripts/python.exe"
elif [ -x .venv/bin/python ];                         then PYTHON_BIN=.venv/bin/python
elif [ -x .venv/Scripts/python.exe ];                 then PYTHON_BIN=.venv/Scripts/python.exe
else                                                       PYTHON_BIN=python3
fi
export PYTHON_BIN
```

### Step 1: Resolve the source

1. If `/init` passed a `canonical_ingest_path`, enter **INIT MODE** and consume that path verbatim. Do not rescan `raw/`. See `references/init-mode.md`.
2. If the source is an arXiv URL, extract the arXiv ID, use `"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py paper <arxiv-id>` to recover the title when possible, then run `"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/init_discovery.py download --raw-root raw --arxiv-id <arxiv-id> --title "<title-or-arxiv-id>"`. Continue from the returned `canonical_ingest_path`. The helper tries arXiv source first and falls back to PDF; do not call `fetch_arxiv.py` for a single paper because it is RSS-only.
3. If the source is a local `.tex`, use it directly.
4. If the source is a local `.pdf`, run the preprocessing pipeline in `references/pdf-preprocessing.md` to produce a prepared `.tex` under `raw/tmp/` before continuing.

Raw persistence rule: never copy or duplicate a file already under `raw/discovered/`, `raw/tmp/`, or `raw/papers/` into a different raw subtree.

### Step 2: Paper identity and enrichment

1. Generate the paper slug:

   ```bash
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py slug "<paper-title>"
   ```

2. Stop-if-exists: if `wiki/papers/{slug}.md` already exists and the arXiv ID or title matches, report and exit. If they differ, resolve the collision per `references/error-handling.md`.
3. When an arXiv ID is available, query Semantic Scholar:

   ```bash
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py paper <arxiv-id>
   ```

   Use the result for `venue`, `year`, `s2_id`, citation count, and the evidence behind the `importance` score (1-5).
4. Optional DeepXiv enrichment, when available. Skip silently if it fails:

   ```bash
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_deepxiv.py brief <arxiv-id>
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_deepxiv.py head <arxiv-id>
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_deepxiv.py social <arxiv-id>
   ```

   `brief` seeds the Key-idea section AND the new `tldr` frontmatter field; `head` sanity-checks your tex parsing against the section structure; `social` is an auxiliary importance signal.

### Step 3: Write the paper page

Open `runtime/schema/entities.yaml` (papers section) for the field set and `runtime/templates/papers.md.tmpl` for body section order. Fill every required frontmatter field; leave `cited_by` empty for now (step 5 backfills it).

Three frontmatter fields the new schema requires you to populate even though they are not lint-required (so existing pages do not break, but new ingests must:):

- `tldr` — one-sentence summary of the paper, suitable as a search/preview line. NOT a multi-paragraph abstract; one sentence.
- `contribution_type` — list of contribution kinds drawn from the closed set `[method, theory, benchmark, analysis, application, system, position, survey]`. A paper may have several (e.g. method + benchmark). Do not invent new values.
- `datasets` — list of dataset / benchmark names the paper uses or introduces (e.g. `MMLU`, `BFCL`, `AppWorld`). Use `[]` when the paper introduces no concrete dataset; do not fabricate.

Before writing, run a **shape check** on the frontmatter you are about to emit — no more than this:

- every required key is present and non-empty
- `importance` ∈ {1,2,3,4,5}; `maturity` on concepts ∈ the documented set; `type` on methods ∈ the documented set
- `contribution_type` items all come from the enum above
- YAML parses

The shape check is intentionally narrow. Backlink symmetry, dangling-node detection, and cross-entity consistency are `/check`'s job, not this skill's.

Body sections to populate, in this order: `Problem & Context`, `Key idea`, `Method`, `Experiment & Results`, `Limitations`, `Open questions`, `My take`, `Related`.

Section semantics:

- **Problem & Context** — what the paper attacks AND where the field stood before this paper. Two-in-one section.
- **Experiment & Results** — setup, primary metrics, and results in one place. Do not stop at "they beat the baseline"; cite the numbers and their conditions.

### Step 4: Concepts, methods, people

Follow `references/dedup-policy.md`. In short:

1. For each candidate concept, call `find-similar-concept` first.
2. For each candidate method (named, reusable technique that other papers could cite), check `wiki/methods/` for an existing entry by name + tags. There is no `find-similar-method` tool — do a directory scan and a manual title/alias compare against `runtime/schema/entities.yaml`'s `methods.name` field.
3. Prefer merging into the top result. Create a new page only when no acceptable candidate exists and the paper's importance justifies it. The `## Method` body section on the paper page is **always** filled (it is this paper's own method narrative); a separate `wiki/methods/{slug}.md` is only created when the technique is namable, reusable, and likely to be referenced by other papers.
4. For each entity you write or edit, write the reverse link in the same turn. The obligation matrix lives in `references/cross-references.md`.
5. Create a `wiki/people/{slug}.md` only for papers with importance ≥ 4. Otherwise append the paper's `[[paper-slug]]` to existing author pages' `## Recent work` only. People entities use `research_areas` (list_str) and a `type.kind` enum (`researcher` / `team` / `organization`); only assign `type.kind = team` or `organization` when the byline itself names the team or organization (do not infer it from a researcher's affiliation).

### Step 5: Paper-to-paper edges and `cited_by`

Skip this whole step in INIT MODE — the parent `/init` handles it at fan-in.

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py references <arxiv-id>
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py citations <arxiv-id>
```

- For each reference whose arXiv ID or title resolves to an existing `wiki/papers/{slug}.md`, add a bibliographic `cites` row to `graph/citations.jsonl`.
- Add a semantic paper-to-paper edge in `graph/edges.jsonl` only when the source text gives a clear cue. Edge-type selection is in `references/cross-references.md`. If no semantic relation cleanly fits, keep only the `cites` row.
- For each citation already in the wiki, append the citer's slug to this paper's `cited_by`.
- Surface unmatched high-citation references in the final report so the user can decide whether to follow up with another `/ingest`.

### Step 6: Topics and index

1. Match the paper's tags against existing `wiki/topics/*.md`. For each match:
   - importance ≥ 4 → append to the topic's `## Seminal works`
   - importance < 4 → append under `## SOTA tracker` or `## Recent work` by year
   - if the paper directly addresses a listed open problem (under `## Open problems` / `### Known gaps` / `### Methodological gaps`), annotate that line on the topic page
2. Do not create new topic pages from `/ingest` — topic creation belongs to `/init` and `/edit`.
3. Append new or edited page entries to `wiki/index.md` under their category headings. Format: each entity kind is a top-level YAML key (matching `runtime/schema/entities.yaml`), with `- slug: <slug>` entries beneath.

### Step 7: Log and rebuild

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py log wiki/ "ingest | added papers/<slug> | updated: <list>"
```

Unless in INIT MODE:

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py rebuild-context-brief wiki/
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py rebuild-open-questions wiki/
```

### Step 7.5: Optional visualization (only if `--visualize` is set)

Skip this step unless the user explicitly passed `--visualize`. Also skip it in INIT MODE — `/init`'s parent process regenerates Canvas + HTML once at fan-in, so individual subagents must not duplicate the work and risk concurrent writes.

When active, regenerate Canvas + HTML (best-effort; visualize failure must not fail `/ingest`):

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/visualize.py generate-canvas wiki/ \
  || echo "WARN: visualize generate-canvas failed; run /visualize manually" >&2
```

`--obsidian` is not regenerated here — `wiki/.obsidian/graph.json` is project-level static config that only changes when `config/visualize.json` palette changes; run `/visualize --obsidian` manually for that case.

### Step 8: Report

Emit one compact summary covering: pages created, pages updated, graph edges added, contradictions surfaced (if any), and high-citation references not yet in the wiki (suggested follow-up ingests). Close with:

```
Wiki: +1 paper, +{N} methods, +{M} concepts, +{K} edges
```

### Step 9: Optional discovery (only if `--discover` is set)

Skip this step unless the user explicitly passed `--discover`. Also skip it in INIT MODE — `/init`'s parent process decides whether to run discovery at fan-in, not individual subagents.

When active, invoke `/discover` with the just-ingested paper as the single anchor:

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/discover.py from-anchors \
  --id <arxiv-id-of-this-paper> \
  --wiki-root wiki \
  --limit 10 \
  --output-checkpoint .checkpoints/ \
  --markdown
```

Append the markdown output to the report under a heading like "Related papers you may want to ingest next". Do not auto-ingest anything from the shortlist — the user picks. If discovery fails (S2 outage, all channels empty), note the failure in one line and continue — a failed `/discover` must not fail an otherwise successful `/ingest`.

## Constraints

- `raw/papers/`, `raw/notes/`, `raw/web/` are user-owned and read-only. Direct local `/ingest` may add prepared sidecars under `raw/tmp/`; direct arXiv ingests may write fetched source artifacts under `raw/discovered/`. INIT MODE treats all of `raw/` as read-only.
- `wiki/graph/` is tool-owned. Edit only through `tools/research_wiki.py`.
- Slugs always come from `tools/research_wiki.py slug`. Never hand-craft.
- Every forward link writes its reverse link in the same turn — the wiki's bidirectional-link invariant. The only exception is links to `wiki/foundations/`, which are terminal.
- In INIT MODE, do not write reverse links into pages that already exist (created by a sibling worktree or scaffold). Record the relationship via `tools/research_wiki.py add-edge` only; the parent `/init` backfills reverse links during fan-in.
- Source priority: `.tex` > `.pdf` > vision API fallback. Never ingest from a PDF when a usable `.tex` is available.
- Ingest is conservative about new entities:
  - importance < 4: at most **1** new concept and **1** new method per paper
  - importance ≥ 4: at most **3** new concepts and **2** new methods per paper
  - Any further candidates must be merged into their nearest existing entry, or left out for `/check` to flag. Rationale and matching rules: `references/dedup-policy.md`.
- A `methods/` page is only justified when the technique is **named**, **reusable**, and **citable** by a future paper. The paper page's own `## Method` body section captures this paper's method narrative; do not duplicate it as a methods entity unless the method earns reuse.
- `/ingest` runs a shape check on its own output (required keys, enum ranges, YAML parses) and stops there. Backlink symmetry, dangling nodes, and full semantic audits belong to `/check`. Do not re-implement them here.
- Assume another `/ingest` may run concurrently in a sibling worktree. All shared-file writes (`graph/edges.jsonl`, `graph/citations.jsonl`, `index.md`, `log.md`) must go through `tools/research_wiki.py` or use append-only semantics. See `references/init-mode.md`.
- In INIT MODE, skip `fetch_s2.py citations`, `fetch_s2.py references`, and the `rebuild-*` commands — the parent `/init` runs them once after fan-in.
- In INIT MODE, also skip Step 7.5 visualization regardless of whether `--visualize` was set; the parent `/init` regenerates Canvas + HTML once at fan-in to avoid concurrent writes from sibling worktrees.

## Error Handling

See `references/error-handling.md`. Highlights: source parse failures cascade tex → PDF → vision API → user handoff; S2 outages default `importance` to 3 and skip citation backfill; DeepXiv outages skip enrichment silently; slug collisions append a numeric suffix.
