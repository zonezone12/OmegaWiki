description: Ingest a paper into the wiki — creates pages (papers + concepts + people + claims) and builds all cross-references and graph edges. Trigger whenever the user says "ingest", "add this paper", drops a `.pdf` / `.tex` / arXiv URL, or asks to fold a paper into the knowledge base.

# /ingest

Turn one paper into a fully wired set of wiki pages. Emit well-formed entities and correct cross-references; leave semantic audits (backlink symmetry, dangling nodes, field-value policing) for `/check`.

Use these local references on demand:

- `references/pdf-preprocessing.md` — arXiv-ID recovery, tex fetching, prepare-paper handoff for direct PDF drops
- `references/dedup-policy.md` — merge-vs-create decision rule for concepts and claims, and the line that separates `/ingest` shape checks from `/check` semantic audits
- `references/cross-references.md` — forward/reverse link matrix and paper-to-paper edge-type selection
- `references/init-mode.md` — manifest-driven handoff from `/init` and parallel-safety conventions
- `references/error-handling.md` — source parse, API, and slug-collision fallbacks

Open `docs/runtime-page-templates.en.md` before drafting any wiki page frontmatter or body sections, and `docs/runtime-support-files.en.md` for `index.md`, `log.md`, and `graph/` formats.

## Inputs

- `source`: one of — arXiv URL (e.g. `https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685`), local `.tex`, local `.pdf`, or a `canonical_ingest_path` handed off by `/init` via `.checkpoints/init-sources.json`

## Outputs

- `wiki/papers/{slug}.md` — new paper page
- `wiki/concepts/{slug}.md`, `wiki/people/{slug}.md`, `wiki/claims/{slug}.md` — created sparingly per `references/dedup-policy.md`, or edited in place to append backlinks
- `wiki/topics/{slug}.md` — edited to append seminal / recent works when the paper clearly belongs under an existing topic
- `wiki/graph/edges.jsonl` — appended via `tools/research_wiki.py add-edge`
- `wiki/index.md` — appended new entries
- `wiki/log.md` — one append line
- `wiki/graph/context_brief.md`, `wiki/graph/open_questions.md` — rebuilt (skipped in INIT MODE; the parent `/init` rebuilds once at fan-in)

## Wiki Interaction

### Reads

- `wiki/index.md` for existing slugs and tags
- `wiki/papers/*.md` to detect an already-ingested paper
- `wiki/concepts/*.md` and `wiki/foundations/*.md` for dedup matches
- `wiki/claims/*.md` for dedup matches
- `wiki/people/*.md` for existing authors
- `wiki/topics/*.md` to place the paper under existing topics
- `wiki/graph/open_questions.md` to notice when the paper addresses a known gap

### Writes

- `wiki/papers/{slug}.md` — CREATE
- `wiki/concepts/{slug}.md` — CREATE (new) or EDIT (append `key_papers`, aliases, variants)
- `wiki/claims/{slug}.md` — CREATE (new) or EDIT (append `evidence` entry)
- `wiki/people/{slug}.md` — CREATE (importance ≥ 4 only) or EDIT (append `Key papers`)
- `wiki/topics/{slug}.md` — EDIT only (no CREATE from `/ingest`)
- `wiki/graph/edges.jsonl` — APPEND via tool
- `wiki/graph/context_brief.md` — REBUILD (skipped in INIT MODE)
- `wiki/graph/open_questions.md` — REBUILD (skipped in INIT MODE)
- `wiki/index.md` — APPEND
- `wiki/log.md` — APPEND via tool

### Graph edges created

- `paper → concept`: `supports` / `extends`
- `paper → foundation`: `derived_from` (foundation is terminal; no reverse link)
- `paper → claim`: `supports` / `contradicts`
- `paper → paper`: `extends` / `supersedes` / `inspired_by` / `contradicts` (see `references/cross-references.md` for selection rules)

## Workflow

**Pre-condition**: working directory contains `wiki/`, `raw/`, and `tools/`. Resolve the Python interpreter once and reuse it:

```bash
if [ -x .venv/bin/python ]; then
  PYTHON_BIN=.venv/bin/python
elif [ -x .venv/Scripts/python.exe ]; then
  PYTHON_BIN=.venv/Scripts/python.exe
else
  PYTHON_BIN=python3
fi
export PYTHON_BIN
```

### Step 1: Resolve the source

1. If `/init` passed a `canonical_ingest_path`, enter **INIT MODE** and consume that path verbatim. Do not rescan `raw/`. See `references/init-mode.md`.
2. If the source is an arXiv URL, fetch the `.tex` under `raw/discovered/` via `"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_arxiv.py`. Fall back to PDF if the source archive is unavailable.
3. If the source is a local `.tex`, use it directly.
4. If the source is a local `.pdf`, run the preprocessing pipeline in `references/pdf-preprocessing.md` to produce a prepared `.tex` under `raw/tmp/` before continuing.

Raw persistence rule: never copy or duplicate a file already under `raw/discovered/`, `raw/tmp/`, or `raw/papers/` into a different raw subtree.

### Step 2: Paper identity and enrichment

1. Generate the paper slug:

   ```bash
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py slug "<paper-title>"
   ```

2. Stop-if-exists: if `wiki/papers/{slug}.md` already exists and the arXiv ID or title matches, report and exit. If they differ, resolve the collision per `references/error-handling.md`.
3. When an arXiv ID is available, query Semantic Scholar:

   ```bash
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py paper <arxiv-id>
   ```

   Use the result for `venue`, `year`, `s2_id`, citation count, and the evidence behind the `importance` score (1-5).
4. Optional DeepXiv enrichment, when available. Skip silently if it fails:

   ```bash
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_deepxiv.py brief <arxiv-id>
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_deepxiv.py head <arxiv-id>
   "$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_deepxiv.py social <arxiv-id>
   ```

   `brief` seeds the Key-idea section; `head` sanity-checks your tex parsing against the section structure; `social` is an auxiliary importance signal.

### Step 3: Write the paper page

Open `docs/runtime-page-templates.en.md` for the paper template. Fill every required frontmatter field; leave `cited_by` empty for now (step 5 backfills it).

Before writing, run a **shape check** on the frontmatter you are about to emit — no more than this:

- every required key is present and non-empty
- `importance` ∈ {1,2,3,4,5}; `status` on claims ∈ the documented set; `maturity` on concepts ∈ the documented set; `confidence` ∈ [0,1]
- YAML parses

The shape check is intentionally narrow. Backlink symmetry, dangling-node detection, and cross-entity consistency are `/check`'s job, not this skill's.

Body sections to populate: Problem, Key idea, Method, Results, Limitations, Open questions, My take, Related.

### Step 4: Concepts, claims, people

Follow `references/dedup-policy.md`. In short:

1. For each candidate concept or claim, call the matching `find-similar-*` tool first.
2. Prefer merging into the top result. Create a new page only when the tool returns no acceptable candidate and the paper's importance justifies it.
3. For each entity you write or edit, write the reverse link in the same turn. The obligation matrix lives in `references/cross-references.md`.
4. Create a `wiki/people/{slug}.md` only for papers with importance ≥ 4. Otherwise append to existing author pages only.

### Step 5: Paper-to-paper edges and `cited_by`

Skip this whole step in INIT MODE — the parent `/init` handles it at fan-in.

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py references <arxiv-id>
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/fetch_s2.py citations <arxiv-id>
```

- For each reference whose arXiv ID or title resolves to an existing `wiki/papers/{slug}.md`, add a single paper-to-paper edge. Edge-type selection is in `references/cross-references.md`. If no existing wiki paper matches, **do not speculate** — skip.
- For each citation already in the wiki, append the citer's slug to this paper's `cited_by`.
- Surface unmatched high-citation references in the final report so the user can decide whether to follow up with another `/ingest`.

### Step 6: Topics and index

1. Match the paper's domain and tags against existing `wiki/topics/*.md`. For each match:
   - importance ≥ 4 → append to the topic's `## Seminal works`
   - importance < 4 → append under `## SOTA tracker` or `## Recent work` by year
   - if the paper directly addresses a listed open problem, annotate that line on the topic page
2. Do not create new topic pages from `/ingest` — topic creation belongs to `/init` and `/edit`.
3. Append new or edited page entries to `wiki/index.md` under their category headings. See `docs/runtime-support-files.en.md` for the exact format.

### Step 7: Log and rebuild

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py log wiki/ "ingest | added papers/<slug> | updated: <list>"
```

Unless in INIT MODE:

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py rebuild-context-brief wiki/
"$PYTHON_BIN" tools/research_wiki.py rebuild-open-questions wiki/
```

### Step 8: Report

Emit one compact summary covering: pages created, pages updated, graph edges added, contradictions surfaced (if any), and high-citation references not yet in the wiki (suggested follow-up ingests). Close with:

```
Wiki: +1 paper, +{N} claims, +{M} concepts, +{K} edges
```

## Constraints

- `raw/papers/`, `raw/notes/`, `raw/web/` are user-owned and read-only. Direct local `/ingest` may add prepared sidecars under `raw/tmp/`; direct arXiv ingests may write fetched source artifacts under `raw/discovered/`. INIT MODE treats all of `raw/` as read-only.
- `wiki/graph/` is tool-owned. Edit only through `tools/research_wiki.py`.
- Slugs always come from `tools/research_wiki.py slug`. Never hand-craft.
- Every forward link writes its reverse link in the same turn — the wiki's bidirectional-link invariant. The only exception is links to `wiki/foundations/`, which are terminal.
- Source priority: `.tex` > `.pdf` > vision API fallback. Never ingest from a PDF when a usable `.tex` is available.
- Ingest is conservative about new entities:
  - importance < 4: at most **1** new concept and **1** new claim per paper
  - importance ≥ 4: at most **3** new concepts and **2** new claims per paper
  - Any further candidates must be merged into their nearest `find-similar-*` result, or left out for `/check` to flag. Rationale and matching rules: `references/dedup-policy.md`.
- `/ingest` runs a shape check on its own output (required keys, enum ranges, YAML parses) and stops there. Backlink symmetry, dangling nodes, and full semantic audits belong to `/check`. Do not re-implement them here.
- Assume another `/ingest` may run concurrently in a sibling worktree. All shared-file writes (`graph/edges.jsonl`, `index.md`, `log.md`) must go through `tools/research_wiki.py` or use append-only semantics. See `references/init-mode.md`.
- In INIT MODE, skip `fetch_s2.py citations`, `fetch_s2.py references`, and the `rebuild-*` commands — the parent `/init` runs them once after fan-in.

## Error Handling

See `references/error-handling.md`. Highlights: source parse failures cascade tex → PDF → vision API → user handoff; S2 outages default `importance` to 3 and skip citation backfill; DeepXiv outages skip enrichment silently; slug collisions append a numeric suffix.
