## 9 Page Types

| Directory | Filename | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `papers/` | `{slug}.md` | structured paper summary |
| `concepts/` | `{concept-name}.md` | cross-paper technical concept |
| `topics/` | `{topic-name}.md` | research direction map |
| `people/` | `{firstname-lastname}.md` | researcher profile |
| `ideas/` | `{idea-slug}.md` | research idea (proposed → tested → validated/failed) |
| `experiments/` | `{experiment-slug}.md` | experiment record (hypothesis → setup → results → claim updates) |
| `claims/` | `{claim-slug}.md` | testable research claim linking papers, experiments, and reviews |
| `Summary/` | `{area-name}.md` | domain-wide survey |
| `foundations/` | `{slug}.md` | foundational background concept (other pages link in; foundations write no reverse link) |

---

## Link Syntax

All internal links use Obsidian wikilinks:

```markdown
[[slug]]                    ← link to any page in this wiki
[[lora-low-rank-adaptation]] ← links to papers/lora-low-rank-adaptation.md
[[flash-attention]]          ← links to concepts/flash-attention.md
```

**Naming convention**: all lowercase, hyphen-separated, no spaces.

---

## Cross-Reference Rules

When writing a forward link, **always write the reverse link simultaneously**:

| Forward action | Required reverse action |
|----------------|------------------------|
| papers/A writes `Related: [[concept-B]]` | concepts/B appends A to `key_papers` |
| papers/A writes `[[researcher-C]]` | people/C appends A to `Key papers` |
| papers/A writes `supports: [[claim-D]]` | claims/D appends `{source: A, type: supports}` to `evidence` |
| topics/T writes `key_people: [[person-D]]` | people/D appends T to `Research areas` |
| concepts/K writes `key_papers: [[paper-E]]` | papers/E appends K to `Related` |
| concepts/K writes part_of `[[topic-F]]` | topics/F appends K to overview paragraph |
| ideas/I writes `origin_gaps: [[claim-C]]` | claims/C appends I to `## Linked ideas` |
| experiments/E writes `target_claim: [[claim-C]]` | claims/C appends `{source: E, type: tested_by}` to `evidence` |
| claims/C writes `source_papers: [[paper-P]]` | papers/P appends C to `## Related` |
| any page links to `[[foundation-X]]` | **no reverse link** — foundations are terminal: they receive inward links from papers/concepts/etc. but never write `key_papers` or any back-reference field |

### graph/ (auto-generated — do not edit)

The `graph/` directory is maintained automatically by `tools/research_wiki.py`, derived from wiki page content.

| File | Content | Generated by |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `edges.jsonl` | typed relationships (extends, contradicts, supports, inspired_by, tested_by, invalidates, supersedes, addresses_gap, derived_from) | `python3 tools/research_wiki.py add-edge` |
| `context_brief.md` | compressed context: claims + gaps + failed ideas + papers + edges (≤8000 chars) | `python3 tools/research_wiki.py rebuild-context-brief` |
| `open_questions.md` | open questions: under-supported claims + open questions from papers/topics | `python3 tools/research_wiki.py rebuild-open-questions` |

Each edge format: `{"from": "node_id", "to": "node_id", "type": "edge_type", "evidence": "...", "date": "..."}`

## Python Environment

Before running any Python tool, ensure the correct environment is active. Detection priority:

1. **Check for `.venv/`**: if present, use the venv interpreter directly — cross-platform safe.
   - Unix/macOS: `.venv/bin/python` exists → call `.venv/bin/python tools/X.py`
   - Windows: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` exists → call `.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/X.py`
2. **Check for conda**: if no venv but conda is active, use `conda run -n <env>` or confirm env is activated
3. **System Python**: if neither exists, use `python3` (Unix/macOS) or `python` (Windows) directly

**Example — calling a tool:**
```bash
# Unix/macOS, .venv/ exists
.venv/bin/python tools/fetch_arxiv.py --hours 24

# Windows, .venv/ exists (Git Bash or PowerShell both accept forward slashes)
.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/fetch_arxiv.py --hours 24

# No venv
python3 tools/fetch_arxiv.py --hours 24      # Unix/macOS
python tools/fetch_arxiv.py --hours 24       # Windows
```

Calling the venv interpreter directly avoids needing to `source activate` (Unix) vs `Activate.ps1` (Windows), and works identically across platforms.

**Environment variables**: all Python tools auto-load API keys from `~/.env` and the project root `.env` via `tools/_env.py` — no manual `export` needed.

---

## Constraints

- **raw/ is append-only, and only for `/init`**: `/init` Step 2 may download newly-discovered sources into `raw/papers/` (additions only — never overwrite an existing file). Every other skill, tool, and subagent (including `/ingest`, `/daily-arxiv`, and all `/init` subagents running `/ingest` in INIT MODE) treats `raw/` as strictly read-only: never modify, overwrite, or delete anything under `raw/`.
- **graph/ is auto-generated**: never manually edit files in `graph/` — only via `tools/research_wiki.py`.
- **Bidirectional links**: always write the reverse link when writing a forward link.
- **tex priority**: .tex > .pdf; fallback chain: tex fails → PDF parse, PDF fails → vision API.
- **index.md updated on every ingest**; log.md is append-only.
- **lint default is report-only**: `--fix` auto-fixes deterministic issues (xref backlinks, missing field defaults); `--suggest` outputs suggestions for non-deterministic issues; `--fix --dry-run` previews fixes.
- **Slug generation rule**: paper title keywords, hyphen-joined, all lowercase.
- **Importance scoring**: 1 = niche, 2 = useful, 3 = field-standard, 4 = influential, 5 = seminal.
- **Failed ideas must record reason**: `failure_reason` is anti-repetition memory — prevents re-exploring known dead ends.
- **Claim confidence range**: 0.0-1.0; re-evaluate every time evidence changes.
- **Experiments must link to a claim**: every experiment requires `target_claim`; results must be written back to the claim's evidence.
- **Experiment code goes in experiments/code/{slug}/**: `/exp-run` writes code to this path (`train.py`, `config.yaml`, `run.sh`, `requirements.txt`) — not to the project root or elsewhere.
- **DeepXiv token**: `DEEPXIV_TOKEN` env variable. If unset, the SDK auto-registers (writes to `~/.env`). Free tier: 10,000 requests/day. When DeepXiv is unavailable, all skills fall back to S2+RSS mode.
