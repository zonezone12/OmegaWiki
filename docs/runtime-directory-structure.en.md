# Runtime Directory Chart

> On-demand reference for the repo layout. The main `CLAUDE.md` keeps only the schema and rules that should stay in immediate context.

## Fast Reminders

- `raw/papers/`, `raw/notes/`, and `raw/web/` are user-owned inputs.
- `raw/discovered/` is for fetched external papers, not user drop-ins.
- `raw/tmp/` is generated intermediate state for `/init` and direct local `/ingest`.
- `graph/` is derived and should be maintained only through `tools/research_wiki.py`.
